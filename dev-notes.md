# Dev Notes

## Next

* update all asserts with NFluent checks
* introduce html view with 
    1.micro templating 
    2.addon with dotliquid (in ext proj)
* introduce async?
* introduce railway?

## Comments

* it actually match routes with case, it should be case insensitive
* change Context.Server to a real class in order to simplify access to common props directly instead of using dict/string


## Done

- [x] complete missing mapping in middleware adapter : headers+server info
- [x] add in sample a template and route with state/view (check test file 5 )
